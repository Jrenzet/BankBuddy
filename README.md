# Financial Planner for Businesses

## A straightforward way to analyse your businesses debt

**Description:**

I will be designing a financial business planning app with emphasis on debt planning. This app will allow the user to 
input specific line items from their past financial statements along with their current debt load, to calculate key 
metrics used by banks to evaluate their businesses. These metrics will include: debt service ratio, security loan to 
value, cash flow surplus/shortfall, and possibly current ratio and leverage. The app will also have the ability to use 
this information to generate projections for the user, with the user being able to add and adjust the following in 
their projections: new debt, increased income from capital investment/expansion, projected interest rates, projected 
income. The application will have the capability to produce a visual representation of multiple projections at a time,
allowing for the user to summarize data for decision-making and for presenting to prospective lenders. Finally, the
application will give a rating on the user’s likelihood of attaining new debt, by taking in the key metrics and using 
them to return a rating of either green, yellow, or red, meaning high likelihood of being approved, lesser likelihood
of being approved, and low likelihood of being approved.

The user of this application will be any business owner or controller of a small to medium size business who is 
considering beginning a new project and would like to evaluate the debt/cash flow implications of this. The projected
user has business savvy and is financially literate, however they would like assistance in summarizing data in a way
that is useful for their financial institution and may even allow them to increase their chances of getting an approval.
I am interested in this project as I used to work in the commercial banking sector and believe an application like this
could be very useful for some business owners. I found that while many people have a general idea of what the bank 
wants to see when applying for a new commercial loan, many do not understand how to evaluate this information in a way 
that allows them to truly understand their businesses’ debt capacity, and also present information in a way that is 
most useful for the bank. When the owner has a better understanding of how the bank evaluates their business, it not 
only expedites the lending process, it also allows for them to have more informed conversations with the bank. This 
increases the banks confidence in their management skills, therefore making approval more likely.

**Summary:**
- Users can learn about their businesses financial health
- Users can run their own projections
- Application will provide organized reports and visuals to show to financial institutions

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add new projects (requiring debt) to a debt projection, allowing me to see how 
payments on this potential new debt will impact my future cash flows, and how these payments will change at different 
interest rates.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of my existing debt, with each loan displaying the date it was funded, 
the date it will mature, interest rate & term, initial loan amount, and amount remaining to be paid.
- As a user, I want to be able to store information from past financial statements.
- As a user, I want the system to use stored information to automatically generate a projection of my future cash
flows, while giving me the ability to modify aspects of this projection.
- As a user, I want to be able to create a visualization/report of my business’s current financial health and any
projections I create for potential new debt.
