# Financial Planner for Businesses

## A straightforward way to analyse your businesses debt

**Description:**

I will be designing a financial business planning app with emphasis on debt planning. This app will allow the user to 
input specific line items from their past financial statements along with their current debt load, and calculate Debt 
Service Coverage (a key metric used by banks to evaluate their businesses). The app will also have the ability to use 
this information to generate projections for the user, with the user being able to add and adjust the following in 
their projections: new debt, increased income from capital investment/expansion, projected interest rates, projected 
income. The application will have the capability to print a summary of debt and projections, allowing for the user to 
summarize data for decision-making and for presenting to prospective lenders. Finally, the application will evaluate the
userâ€™s likelihood of attaining new debt, by using the projection to return a rating of either green, yellow, or red, 
meaning high likelihood of being approved, lesser likelihood of being approved, and low likelihood of being approved.

The user of this application will be any business owner or controller of a small to medium size business who is 
considering beginning a new project and would like to evaluate the debt/cash flow implications of this. The projected
user has business savvy and is financially literate, however they would like assistance in summarizing data in a way
that is useful for their financial institution and may even allow them to increase their chances of getting an approval.
I am interested in this project as I used to work in the commercial banking sector and believe an application like this
could be very useful for some business owners. 

**Summary:**
- Users can learn about their businesses financial health
- Users can run their own projections
