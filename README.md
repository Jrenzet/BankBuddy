# Financial Planner for Businesses

## A straightforward way to analyse your businesses debt

**Description:**

I will be designing a financial business planning app with emphasis on debt planning. This app will allow the user to 
input specific line items from their past financial statements along with their current debt load, and calculate Debt 
Service Coverage (a key metric used by banks to evaluate their businesses). The app will also have the ability to use 
this information to generate projections for the user, with the user being able to add and adjust the following in 
their projections: new debt, increased income from capital investment/expansion, projected interest rates, projected 
income. The application will have the capability to print a summary of debt and projections, allowing for the user to 
summarize data for decision-making and for presenting to prospective lenders. Finally, the application will evaluate the
userâ€™s likelihood of attaining new debt, by using the projection to return a rating of either green, yellow, or red, 
meaning high likelihood of being approved, lesser likelihood of being approved, and low likelihood of being approved.

The user of this application will be any business owner or controller of a small to medium size business who is 
considering beginning a new project and would like to evaluate the debt/cash flow implications of this. The projected
user has business savvy and is financially literate, however they would like assistance in summarizing data in a way
that is useful for their financial institution and may even allow them to increase their chances of getting an approval.
I am interested in this project as I used to work in the commercial banking sector and believe an application like this
could be very useful for some business owners. 

**Summary:**
- Users can learn about their businesses financial health
- Users can run their own projections
- Application will print organized reports and visuals to show to financial institutions

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add new loans to a projection, allowing me to see how 
payments on this potential new debt will impact my future cash flows, and how these payments will change at different 
interest rates.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a summary of my existing debt, with key information for each loan
- As a user, I want to be able to store information from past financial statements.
- As a user, I want the system to use stored information to automatically generate a projection of my future cash
flows, while giving me the ability to modify aspects of this projection.
- As a user, I want to be able to generate a rating of my likelihood of being approved for new debt.
